        Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers and apply the patch to the index.

        The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged. This can be
        quicker and more flexible than using the interactive hunk selector. However, it is easy to confuse oneself and create a patch that does not
        apply to the index. See EDITING PATCHES below.`),

        Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching <pathspec> but also where the index already has an entry. This adds,

        Update the index by adding new files that are unknown to the index and files modified in the working tree, but ignore files that have been
        removed from the working tree. This option is a no-op when no <pathspec> is used.

        This option is primarily to help users who are used to older versions of Git, whose "git add <pathspec>..." was a synonym for "git add
        --no-all <pathspec>...", i.e. ignored removed files.`),

        Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is useful for,

        If some files could not be added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the operation, but continue adding the others. The command
